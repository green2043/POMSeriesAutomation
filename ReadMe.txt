Got it! Here's the **updated version** of your original Git command explanation (the long one that starts from navigation and ends with pushing to GitHub), now **with added details on what to do when updating your project and pushing again**, plus an explanation of `git commit --amend` and how to fix the `non-fast-forward` error:

---

## ✅ Full Git Workflow Explanation (With Amending & Re-Pushing)

---

### ✅ Initial Navigation


C:\Users\satya>D:


* Switches from the C: drive to the D: drive.


D:\>cd D:\SatyaWS\WebAuomationSelenium2024


* Changes the directory to your Selenium project folder on the D: drive.


D:\SatyaWS\WebAuomationSelenium2024>dir


* Lists all files and folders in the current directory to verify the project structure.

---

### ✅ Git Initialization


git init


* Initializes a new Git repository by creating a `.git/` folder in the current directory.
* Now the folder becomes version-controlled, though no files are tracked yet.

---

### ✅ Checking Git Status


git status


* Shows the current status:

  * Branch name (`master` or `main`)
  * Untracked files
  * No commits yet

---

### ✅ Adding Files to Git Staging Area


git add .


* Adds all untracked and modified files in the current directory to the staging area.
* You might see a warning like:

  
  warning: in the working copy of '...CustomXpath.java', LF will be replaced by CRLF
  

  This is just a line-ending conversion warning. Safe to ignore unless working cross-platform.

---

### ✅ Rechecking Git Status


git status


* Confirms that all files are now staged and ready for commit.

---

### ✅ First Commit


git commit -m "webAutomation ractice Code"


* Commits staged files with a message. You had a typo: `"ractice"` → `"practice"`

---

### ✅ Fixing a Commit Message (Amend)


git commit --amend -m "webAutomation Practice Code"


* **Overwrites the last commit** with a new message or new changes (if you add files).
* Helpful when fixing typos or adding a file you forgot.

**⚠ Important:** If you've already pushed the commit, this changes history and will need a force push.

---

### ✅ Adding Remote GitHub Repository


git remote add origin https://github.com/green2043/WebAuomationSelenium2024.git


* Links your local repo to a GitHub repository called `origin`.

---

### ✅ Pushing Code to GitHub


git push origin master


* Pushes your local `master` branch to GitHub.

---

## 🔄 When You Update Your Project Later

Let’s say you added new files or made changes. The process is:

1. **Check changes:**

   
   git status
   

2. **Add updated files:**

   
   git add .
   

3. **Commit changes:**

   
   git commit -m "Added new tests and updated utilities"
   

4. **Push changes to GitHub:**

   
   git push origin master
   

✅ This will send your new commit(s) to GitHub.

---

## 🛠️ If You Used `--amend` After Pushing

If you amended a commit **after it was already pushed**, and then ran:


git push origin master


You’ll get this error:


! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs...


This happens because Git sees that your local commit history is different (rewritten).

### ✅ Fix: Force Push

If you’re **working alone** or you're sure it's safe:


git push origin master --force


OR safer:


git push origin master --force-with-lease


> `--force-with-lease` ensures no one else pushed in the meantime.

### ✅ If You’re on a Team

Instead of forcing, try:


git pull origin master --rebase
git push origin master


---

## ✅ Summary of `git commit --amend`

* Use it to correct the last commit (message or content).
* Use **before pushing** ideally.
* If used after pushing, follow with `--force` push.

Let me know if you'd like to save this as a file, or if you want a visual diagram of commit flow and `--amend` behavior.
